TRIE
The Trie data structure is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings. (Only strings). 
A trie stores a set of strings as a tree of characters. It's also called a prefix tree, and it's most useful for letting you look up words by prefix.
It is commonly used for efficient retrieval and storage of keys in a large dataset. 
The structure supports operations such as insertion, search, and deletion of keys, making it a valuable tool in fields like computer science and information retrieval.

SKIP LISTS
A skip list is a probabilistic data structure. The skip list is used to store a sorted list of elements or data with a linked list. 
It allows the process of the elements or data to view efficiently. 
In one single step, it skips several elements of the entire list, which is why it is known as a skip list.
